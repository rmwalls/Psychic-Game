Week 3 Homework. Psychic game in JS

The point of this game, for the game player, is to guess what letter the computer program has randomly selected. Note, the computer can only choose a lower case letter of the alphabet, it doesn't have the choice to pick, say, the Tab key or the Spacebar. If you guess these keys, they will count against you. 

If you guess the letter within 9 tries, you will WIN! and be asked if you would like to play again. Similarly, if you use 9 guesses without a match, you LOSE and are also asked if you would like to play again.
